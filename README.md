# DSA Assignment: Linear Structures (REQUIRED)

This problem uses **linear data structures** in the form of arrays.

Accepting the GitHub Assignment will create a repo with a challenge at `/src/main/java/tech.strategio` and its corresponding unit tests at `/src/test/java/tech.strategio`. Clone the repo generated for you by GitHub Classroom and use your Java IDE of choice.

The exercise contains a class with a method. Complete the method in an IDE such that the unit tests pass. You should run your unit tests often, either through your Java IDE or through the command line (`gradle test`).

To submit the exercise, push a commit to GitHub. Automated tests will run, and youâ€™ll see a green checkbox if ALL unit tests pass.

## Assignment

### E01 - Contains duplicate

*Required, Difficulty rating: 1*

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
